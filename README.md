## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Even though this is not my first hmtl-css page, I learned a couple of new things and I practice some others that I hadn't used in a while.

```html
<h1>Like the use of tables, which I haven't used in months.</h1>
<table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td class="td-title">Calories</td>
            <td class="td-info">277kcal</td>
          </tr>
       </tbody>
      </table>
```
```css
.list{
  list-style-type: disc;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to keep improving my css and html knowledge, and doing this kind of challenges will help me.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-type) - This helped me to remember how to apply a specific style for <table>.
